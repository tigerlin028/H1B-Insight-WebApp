          Introduction
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Every year about 85,000 H1B Visas are given to internationals to work in America. Many of those internationals,
          who aspire to work in US, look for H1B Sponsors. Some of them are already in the US and trying to look for new jobs,
          change jobs, apply for Green Cards, etc. in companies that can sponsor H1B Visa for them.

          Most of the decisions taken today, by individuals to join a company or change to a new company, are based on the
          'branding' of the company and references. But, we believe that such decisions should be based on "Data". Our goal
          is to provide everyone a tool that grades companies based on various kinds of H1B related Data from various US
          government agencies like USCIS, US Department of Labor.

          H1B Visa Holder in US. We provide grades for companies based on their past Immigration, Wage, and Other Data.
